# PokeCatalog

Ever happened to you that you can't remember the name of that strange pokemon, with **PokeCatalog** you can search your pokemon by name or Poke ID. 

This project is built with the following technologies/libraries:
- React
- Tailwind css
- Formik
- AutoComplete (Material UI)
- Yup
- React hot toast

## My learning

### Using React Routes & React Browser Routes
Manage the routes of the application, with a Routes navigator, in order to render the components that go according to the route.
### Using Formik with Yup and the validation shemas
Building forms with Formik is really rewarding, especially when it comes to validating fields. Yup makes it easy to create validation shema. 
Formik + Yup = awesome forms ðŸ’—

### Axios config: Interceptors 
In Axios, interceptors are functions used to intercept and manipulate HTTP requests and responses before they are sent or received by the application. These interceptors allow you to modify or add information to the requests and responses, tremendously fascinating.
